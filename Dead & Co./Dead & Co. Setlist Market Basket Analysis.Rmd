## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(dplyr)
library(visNetwork)

Dead <- read.transactions("Dead&Co.csv", format = "basket", sep = ",", cols = NULL)
```

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(stringr)
library(DT)
library(plotly)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(visNetwork)
library(igraph)
install.packages("kableExtra")
library(kableExtra)
```


```{r}
library("RColorBrewer")
arules::itemFrequencyPlot(Dead,
   topN=30,
   col=brewer.pal(8,'Pastel2'),
   main='Relative Song Frequency Plot',
   type="relative",
   ylab="Song Frequency (Relative)")
```

```{r}
sel <- plot(rules, measure=c("support", "lift"), 
          shading = "confidence",
          interactive = TRUE)

subrules2 <- head(sort(rules, by="confidence"),20)
ig <- plot( subrules2, method="graph", control=list(type="items") )
ig_df <- get.data.frame( ig, what = "both" )
nodesv %>%
   visNodes(size = 10) %>%
   visLegend() %>%
   visEdges(smooth = FALSE) %>%
   visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE, nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
   visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE) %>%
   visEdges(arrows = 'from') %>%
   visPhysics(
        solver = "barnesHut",
        maxVelocity = 35,
        forceAtlas2Based = list(gravitationalConstant = -6000)
      )
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#summary of dataset
summary(Dead)

#looks at all 157 shows' setlists
#inspect(Dead)

#first two shows
inspect(head(Dead,6))
inspect(tail(Dead,3))

#total number of shows 
length(Dead)

#top 6 most frequently played songs in decreasing order
head(sort(decreasing = TRUE, itemFrequency(Dead)))

#bottom 6 least frequently played songs in decreasing order
tail(sort(decreasing = TRUE, itemFrequency(Dead)))

#prior probability of hearing specific song 
itemFrequency(Dead)["Ramble On Rose"]

#rules for hearing a specific song
rules <- apriori(Dead, parameter = list(supp = (5/length(Dead)), conf = .50, minlen = 2, maxlen = 2),appearance = list(default = "lhs", rhs = "Fire On The Mountain"), control = list(verbose = FALSE));inspect(sort(rules,by="confidence"))

#SUPPORT = fraction of shows that satisfy rule or fraction of shows that have all items referenced in rule 

#CONFIDENCE = (posterior) probability that show has item on RHS given it has all items on LHS rule 

#COVERAGE = fraction of shows that have all items in the LHS of rule

#LIFT = how many times more likely that song in RHS appears in a show when it contains all items in LHS

#COUNT = # of shows that satisfy rule (have all items referenced in rule)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
rules <- apriori(Dead, parameter = list(supp = 5/length(Dead), conf = 0.60, minlen=2, maxlen = 3),control=list(verbose=FALSE))
length(rules)
rules <- rules[!is.redundant(rules)];rules <- rules[is.significant(rules, Dead)]
length(rules)
inspect(sort(rules,by="support"))

```

```{r}
inspect(tail(Dead,3))
```
